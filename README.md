# Random-Password-Generator
This webapp generates a random password via Javascript.

The password is randomly generated on device. It isn't generated in backend of the server.

Frontend : HTML, CSS, Plain Javascript. 
Backend : PHP.

Also, this webapp is also hosted at http://rangenpassword2021ani.atwebpages.com/

I know it is not a HTTPS site because it is free hosted site on AwardSpace & AwardSpace (hosting company) don't allow HTTPS hosting on their free service.
